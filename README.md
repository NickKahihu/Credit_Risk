# Credit_Risk_Model
Lending Club is the largest online loan marketplace, facilitating personal loans, business loans, and financing of medical procedures. Borrowers can easily access lower interest rate loans through a fast online interface.

These files contain complete loan data for all loans issued including the current loan status (Current, Charged-off, Fully Paid, etc.) and latest payment information. The file containing loan data through the "present" contains complete loan data for all loans issued through the previous completed calendar quarter. Additional features include credit scores, number of finance inquiries, and collections among others. The file is a matrix of about 39 thousand observations and 111 variables. A data dictionary is provided in a separate file.
